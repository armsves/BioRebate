- **‚ùå Non-Compliant**: Credential does not meet verification requirements
- **‚è≥ Pending**: Credential is waiting for blockchain confirmation
- **üîÑ Revoking**: Credential is currently being revoked
- **üö´ Revoked**: Credential has been revoked and is no longer valid
- **‚è∞ Expired**: Credential has expired and is no longer valid
- **üîç NotFound**: No credential was found matching the criteria

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

For production use, consider setting up environment variables for sensitive configuration:

```bash
# .env.local

# Issuance Configuration
VITE_ISSUER_DID=your-issuer-did
VITE_ISSUER_API_KEY=your-issuer-api-key
VITE_CREDENTIAL_ID=your-credential-id
VITE_ISSUER_PARTNER_ID=issuer-partner-id

# Verification Configuration
VITE_VERIFIER_DID=your-verifier-did
VITE_VERIFIER_API_KEY=your-verifier-api-key
VITE_PROGRAM_ID=your-program-id
VITE_VERIFIER_PARTNER_ID=verifier-partner-id

# General Configuration
VITE_LOCALE=en
VITE_REDIRECT_URL_FOR_ISSUER=http://localhost:5173/issue
```

### Environment-Based Configuration

The application uses environment-based configuration for Widget and API URLs:

- **Staging Environment**: Uses staging URLs for widget and API endpoints
- **Sandbox Environment**: Uses sandbox URLs for widget and API endpoints

The URLs are configured in `src/config/environments.ts` and automatically switch based on the environment selected in the NavBar dropdown.

### Partner ID Management

The application automatically switches Partner IDs based on the current route:

- **Issuance Route** (`/issue`): Uses `VITE_ISSUER_PARTNER_ID` as default
- **Verification Route** (`/verify`): Uses `VITE_VERIFIER_PARTNER_ID` as default

The Partner ID is displayed and editable in the NavBar. When you navigate between Issuance and Verification flows, the Partner ID will automatically update to the appropriate default for that flow. You can still manually edit the Partner ID in the NavBar to test different configurations.

### SDK Configuration

The application uses the AIR Credential SDK with the following configuration options:

- **Theme**: Auto (adapts to system preference)
- **Locale**: English (en)
- **Endpoint**: Default AIR endpoint
- **Redirect URL**: Configurable for credential issuance redirection
